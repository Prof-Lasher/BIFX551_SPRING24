## Part 1:

Made a package that does simple math things, one takes an input and adds it to itself and another multiplies an input against itself.

```{r example}
library(RPackageExample)
x <- 7
multSelf(x)
addSelf(x)
```

## Part 2:

Took a look at test-drop-na, since we have convered drop-na a good bit in class already.

This test is pretty obvious: you need to make sure when a dropped variable is specified, that is the variable dropped

```{r test for tidyr, echo=FALSE}
test_that("specifying (a) variables considers only that variable(s)", {
  df <- tibble(x = c(1, 2, NA), y = c("a", NA, "b"))
```

This test is less obvious: Version control, making sure old methods do not influence results.

```{r test for tidyr, echo=FALSE}
test_that("works with rcrd cols", {
  skip_if(
    packageVersion("vctrs") <= "0.3.8",
    "vec_detect_complete() treated rcrds differently"
  )
```
