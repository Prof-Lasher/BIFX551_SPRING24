## About me

I have graduated with a B.S. in Biochemistry and aim to use bioinformatics to broaden my skills and opportunities.

## Another mouth to feed

I adopted a grey cat named Minnie who is either *very* cuddly or *very* playful. There is **absolutely** no inbetween.

### Hobbies

I have many hobbies but below are my most favorite:
