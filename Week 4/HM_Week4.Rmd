Loading Dataset-1
```{r}
Breast_C<- read.csv("https://query.data.world/s/uwoxma5cvr2gqrzlhafwwpc5tietdh?dws=00000", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE);

```{r}
Breast_C<- Breast_C[-1]
drop_na(Breast_C)
str(Breast_C)

head(Breast_C)
tail(Breast_C)
summary(Breast_C)
```

grouping by diagnosis and counting the number 
```{r}
Breast_C %>%
  group_by(diagnosis) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```

Calculating the Frequency of cases for each diagnosis
```{r}
table(Breast_C$diagnosis)

```

Histogram of Diagnosis with two levels 
```{r}
ggplot(Breast_C, aes(x = diagnosis)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightgreen", color = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Diagnosis",
       x = "Diagnosis", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Summary Statistics of Numerical Variables
```{r}
Numerical_Variables <- select_if(Breast_C, is.numeric)
Summary_NV <- Numerical_Variables %>%
  summarise_all(list(mean = mean, sd = sd))
print(Summary_NV)

The dataset is interesting due to its significant medical relevance, offering detailed measurements important for early detection and diagnosis. It contains a wide range of features, including compactness and smoothness, providing a large view of breast cancer characteristics. Anticipated challenges include biased performance and issues related to data quality and consistency. One question I would like addressed would be how to ensure consistent predictive accuracy in modeling efforts.

This dataset is interesting as it has valuable insights into the relationship between different kinds of health factors and the occurrence of strokes.Anticipated difficulties can come from handling numerical variables and ensuring the data's reliability.A question i would like to explore would be on the average glucose level variation between individuals who have experienced stroke and those who have not. 



Loading Dataset-3

Filtering data for a specific year
```{r}

  labs(title = "Prevalence of Coronary Heart Disease Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Prevalence") +

```
This dataset is interesting because it provides different demographic groups, national, state, county, and selected sites regions across the United States over time. The anticipated difficulties could be handling discrepancies and complexity in the data. A question i would like answered in this dataset is if there are any disparities.
